/**
 * Include this gradle file if you are building against this as a standalone gradle library project,
 * as opposed to building it as part of the git-tree. This is typically the file you want to include
 * if you create a new project in Android Studio. Besides, SetupDesign library is dependent with
 * SetupCompat library, you should also include setupcompat library in project.
 *
 * For example, you can include the following in your settings.gradle file:
 *      include ':setupdesign'
 *      project(':setupdesign').projectDir = new File(PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY)
 *      include ':setupcompat'
 *      project(':setupcompat').projectDir = new File(PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY)
 *
 * And then you can include the :setupdesign project as one of your dependencies
 *      dependencies {
 *          implementation project(path: ':setupdesign')
 *      }
